Zoho to-do



When the folder is setup for source and output files the following 
AD group needs to be provided read/write access. Also maybe check 
to make sure other people donâ€™t randomly have access.

Analytics_Data_RW


Ok Dylan Bransby/Tanya Lee, I have a note in the requirements doc saying : 

remove all numbers that don't start with +61

Not sure if this is right, something may have been lost in translation....
