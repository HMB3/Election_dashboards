The survey was emailed to around 29 thousand temporary election staff members between 15/12/2021 and 22/12/2021. 
The overall response rate was approximately `r all_resp_rate` per cent, with `r format(complete_responses, big.mark=",")` 
completed surveys (a completed survey response rate of `r complete_resp_rate` per cent). The highest response rate was from 
PPM's (over 50 per cent) and lowest for OA's (less than 20 per cent; see Table 1).
